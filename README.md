## Course Overview

- **Supervised Learning**: This course provides detailed examples of supervised learning using both classification and regression techniques. We explore when and how to use each algorithm based on the problem type and dataset characteristics.
  - **Classification**: We cover K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks for classification tasks. Each algorithm is explained in detail with practical notebooks and real datasets.
  - **Regression**: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Neural Networks for regression are explored in depth. You will learn about the situations where each regression technique is appropriate, as well as evaluation metrics for regression models.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: We cover clustering algorithms, specifically focusing on K-means Clustering, and discuss how and when to use clustering for data exploration.

## Deep Dive into Algorithms

### Classification Algorithms

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm used for classification. It is simple and effective, especially with smaller datasets. The KNN algorithm classifies new data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors, making it suitable for problems where decision boundaries are complex.

2. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification that estimates the probability of an observation belonging to a particular class. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression uses a logistic function to model the outcome, making it suitable for binary and multiclass problems.

3. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between features, which makes it simple but surprisingly effective for text classification and spam detection.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful classification algorithm that aims to find the optimal hyperplane to separate classes. SVM is particularly effective for high-dimensional spaces and cases where the decision boundary is not linearly separable.

5. **Neural Networks for Classification**: Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that work similarly to the human brain. They are effective for complex classification problems, especially with larger datasets and non-linear relationships.

### Regression Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**: A foundational regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation. It works well for problems where the relationship is roughly linear.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: An extension of linear regression that models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. Useful when multiple factors influence the outcome.

3. **Neural Networks for Regression**: Neural networks can also be used for regression tasks, capturing complex relationships between features. They are beneficial for non-linear regression problems where traditional linear models may not perform well.

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

1. **K-means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions the dataset into `K` distinct, non-overlapping clusters based on the similarity of data points. It is used for data exploration, pattern recognition, and segmentation tasks.
